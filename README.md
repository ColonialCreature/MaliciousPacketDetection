# 🛡️ Malicious and Malformed Packet Detection

A machine learning–based network security project that detects malicious or malformed packets using supervised classification algorithms. This project applies data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training to enhance Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) with intelligent, data-driven defense capabilities.
